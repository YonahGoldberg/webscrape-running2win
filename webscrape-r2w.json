Matt and Sam then turned back and we got lost, somehow making it to another reservoir. Im pretty sure we just ran a straight line 7 miles away from where we started but Lukes mom had to pick us up because we couldn't find our way back and didn't want to run another 7 miles. It literally took us 10 minutes to get back to the reservoir where we met at. I think luke wanted to call this the voltage run because we were running near a bunch of power lines on top of the mountain but I don't think it really matters because I couldn't find my way back up there if I tried...

Really cool and fun race because I didn't know what to expect from myself because I hadn't raced in so long. I think the time really reflects my hard work over the Summer and I'm really happy with the result. The plan was for me, Luke and Adam to go out together and sit on the front pack but everyone went out hard so I decided to stay back about 50 meters from the front pack so I wouldn't burn out early like last year. I then passed like 10 people on the downhill, really letting my legs fly and caught up to Luke and we worked together for about a mile side by side catching up to a bunch of people. Eventually Luke ended up dropping back a couple seconds behind me towards the end which sucks because it would have been cool to finish the race kicking against each other, but I caught up to Adam and worked with him until the end. I ended up out kicking him (I basically started my kick pretty early because I suck at sprinting) and came in 5th place, 1st for Hall. I know Adam and Luke are itching to kick my ass next time so i've gotta watch out. I think it would be cool to get a bunch of guys next time to go out all together at Hall on Tuesday. Overall, great race. I know I couldn't have run as fast as I did without other people pushing me and without people to run with over the Summer. &#128077;"},{"distanceUnit":0,"distance":3,"date":"2018-09-08T04:00:00.000Z","comments":"This is the warm up and cool down roughly."},{"distanceUnit":0,"distance":11,"date":"2018-09-09T04:00:00.000Z","timeHours":1,"timeMinutes":23,"timeSeconds":2,"paceSeconds":28,"paceMinutes":7,"paceHours":0,"comments":"Longest run to date and it wasn't very fun doing it alone.

I was trying to sinc my watch and Adam bolts away saying were starting and I was like what the hell. Why do i keep running in the rain with my shirt on its so stupid. My shirt got so heavy and it was just uncomfortable. Then I made the stupid mistake and took it off and then I had to miserably put it around my waste but it was so heavy from the rain that it weighed me down and was even more uncomfortable and we were running so I couldn't put it back on. Someone tell me what is the optimal choice to make here what do I do with my shirt? Anyways, me luke brudz thomas and adam went up beacon and then came down condos and went through wampanoag to hall. It was pretty great but luke kept on splashing everyone and being sped as usual. Everyone was getting kinda sick of him and then he slipped and fell onto his back shirtless at wampanoag and it was the best karma I've ever seen. We got back and did some nice core. I'm gonna start talking more in my logs i've realized that because i can type 98 words per minute (thats my record) that if I just type really fast and don't really care about punctuation or any of that I can write a crazy long log in like a couple minutes.

I just finished reading everyone's log (who logged) about the Wickham race today. I've started to really enjoy reading people's logs, especially after races, to see how it went for them. Each log is kind've like a story and its really fun to see them describe how their race went for them because I most likely didn't get to see them. First off, shout out to Chris Murray for spiking someone in the head after they fell in front of him. I don't know why I find this so funny but its just so stupid that he tried to jump over the guy but still skimmed his head (No offense Chris but that guy probs hates your guts rn). Also, shout out to Thomas Robinson for losing his shoe in the last 800 and continuing the race without it. Not gonna talk about that many other people's races because I'm sure you could just read their logs but I find it kind've sad that the tone overall seems a bit negative. It's the last race of the season and I was hoping everyone would run well, but I guess the combination of the mud, cold weather, etc... made it harder for people to course PR. Now onto my race. Beginning from last night, I had a shit ton of homework and only got like five hours of sleep and I'm not sure if this affected me or not but I was definitely tired during the day and slept for parts of English and Gov. I also tried to sleep a bit before the meet but Brandon Wolmer kept on bending down to sit on me and everytime I opened my eyes I just saw his ass so it was ridiculously hard to relax. Also, Naiwen kept on sticking grass in my mouth and started reading some of his English book to me. That part I actually liked it was a pretty good book and to be fair, Naiwen should be a guy that records Audiobooks, his voice is so soothing. Anyways, even though I was tired, I felt pretty decent before the race because the weather was cool and I hydrated a ton throughout the day and my pee was literally clear like wtf how does that even happen. When the gun went off I immediately tried to get in front of the pack because I didn't want to get stuck behind the mob of kids that I knew I was faster than. Thinking back on it now, I think that it was smart of me to go out hard at the beginning, but I probably could've eased off the pace a bit heading into the first hill and going through the mile mark a bit fast probably impacted the rest of my race negatively. In the moment though, it was more important to me to stay in the front pack of guys, which by the way was pretty cool because we were really packed up. I really do think the first uphill is a lot worse than the green monster because it's so gradual and painful. At least for me it hurts a lot more than the green monster. After the uphill our pack of like six guys narrowed out a bit more and I rolled down the downhill into the flat 800ish before the green monster. At that point there was one kid from another school and I think me, Austin, PK, James and idk who else but I know I was trailing those guys. I tried to make a little surge by PK but it was really unfortunate that he thought I was a southington guy apparently and bodied me back which really through me off for a bit there. I managed to recover though and I don't blame him at all for being physical, I probably would've too if someone came up on my shoulder like that. Like I said, it was just a bit unfortunate. From there I dropped back a bit and never really was able to recover back to those guys as PK started to really roll. I surged passed James on the green monster but he surged back by me at the top and I basically spent the rest of the race just keeping him in sight and trying to hang on. I'm not sure why, but at the top of uphills in races recently my arms have been getting really tired and from the top of the green monster, I wasn't really able to drive them as much after. I'm not sure if this is a form problem because I was focussing on the hill to drop my shoulders but maybe I should do a bit more strength training, idk. Near the finish line I really had nothing left, but I thought I was fine because when I looked over my left shoulder I couldn't see anyone close by. That was my crucial mistake because as soon as I looked back forward I saw the southington guy on my right, kicking right by me. I tried to recover but I was just so dead I couldn't beat him. Big oof. Anyways, I finished 6th and 4th for Hall and course PRed by like 4 seconds so I was satisfied with my result and I think it was a good way to end my season. Also, shout out for PK for taking the dub! He raced really well despite our little hiccup before the green monster. Looking back on my sophomore cross season, I think I ran really consistently and at least course PRed every race. My only race that was a let down was New Hampshire where I went out way too hard and couldn't recover. It's sad that it's over but I'm excited for captains speeches tomorrow and looking forward for indoor. I'm also really excited to race the mile time trial next week and hopefully break 5 to get that varsity jacket! Sam Makarawitz (I probably spelled his last name wrong) always puts his goal at the end of his logs so I think I might start doing that too, idk. I bet none of you actually made it to this point in the log, i've just kinda been typing and i don't really know how long it is, but if you have, shout out to you. I guess I'm gonna end it here and go to bed. I'm probably not gonna write a log this long for a while, maybe for the Armory idk. As always, chasing 17:30."},{"distanceUnit":0,"distance":2,"date":"2018-10-16T04:00:00.000Z","comments":"like my warm up and cool down about.

I felt good and my pain in my knee shifted up a bit more to around my hip, which Andrew Miller said was a good sign. So yeah, I went to him after the run and did some more hips and rolling. I'm not sure if this is just me having a problem with tight quads and stuff but my left leg is starting to feel tight also. It really sucks that the roller I ordered didn't come today because its gonna have to come wednesday and I can't roll out more until then. I have a stick roller but its really bad quality and just doesn't work as well as the foam ones. I think i'll go for a similar 4ish tomorrow depending on how I feel and then start workouts next week. Andrew said that I should do mainly thresholds for now so maybe I'll do like 800s or whatever works.

I got blood all over my new gloves and my jacket which kind've sucks, but I guess I can just throw them in the wash.

We got out together with a 5:17 first mile, which was a bit fast, and then worked the up hill and past a bunch of people. Then going into the second mile I think he dropped back a bit but was apparently just sitting on me because he passed me later. The third mile was where it hit me hard. I was doing so well beforehand and I know my splits were negative but I don't think too much. On that last uphill a lot of people passed me. I was around 20th at the start and dropped back to 34th for the finish. I was so locked in and exhausted but I remember that every once and a while I would hear some heavy breathing and I would think, is this Luke? Is this the end for my dream of being second for Hall? And then it wouldn't be. And I keep chugging along and I hear some more breathing and I think, OK this has got to be Luke, but its not. Then going into the final right turn before the woods and back into the field Luke comes up and we started working together again before he eventually passed me and I think, OK at least its not ADAM HANLON because I kept on telling him I was going to out kick him. Going into the final 300ish meters I hear heavy breathing and I think, OH NO! Adam slingshots around the turn and surges past me. I tried to go with him but to no avail. I'm such a bot and I know he's going to be making fun of me now forever. So 34th, in 17:30. Was it the time I was hoping for? No, but I'm trying to think positive that it just means there's a lot more room for improvement. I'm excited for Wave Mania where were going to cool down into New Jersey. Epic. Also congrats to the JV guys who are showing how deep we are, especially Jamie and Jake even though they're bots and missed the finish line. Congrats to the Freshmen who ran amazing for their first race of the season! We've got some pretty fast guys and I'm excited to see what they can do.

I slept through econ because we had a sub and I took a shit like 4 times and I felt OK towards the end of the day. Went out slower, I think I actually kept even splits for the race and put myself in a pretty good position. Was passing people for basically all of the second and third mile. Walker rolled me up on the green monster but I imagined the string coach was talking about and tried to reel him back in. Sopho and I both passed him at the tree but he caught up to me again and ended up beating me by like 10 seconds. The mud at the finishing stretch completely sapped my energy and I barely kicked, so many people passed me at the end which sucked. That being said, I don't really like to get down on a performance if I gave it my all and I did so I'm pretty happy. It was a really cool race and a great way to end the season, 10th in the state isn't bad but everyone better look out because were gonna be even better next year.

It feels worse to run poorly in a relay because everyone is counting on you but I know I can do better. Time 2:08. Later, the 1k was a really weird race. Jack Martin asked before if anyone wanted to take the lead and everyone was like nope, but then the slowest seed took it out money in the bank style and then died and no one wanted to make a decisive move to take first. It felt way too slow but I wasn’t confident because at the time I was in like third and didn’t want to pass Jackson and die out like the 800. Ended up sitting on the inside which was a bad move because everyone just passed me quickly on the right and I got boxed in. Kicked hard to get the states qualifier by .07. Two mediocre races, but like coach said, the first race of the season should be the worst.

On the warmup for the 1k I felt sluggish and was coughing a shit ton still and when I got off the line my legs felt like dead weights and I just couldn't move them fast enough. I didn't go out fast enough. The plan was to go out at the front and run the fastest time I could, not caring about what anyone else was doing. I was pushed to the back at the start and even though Sam moved over a bit to let me by I wasn't able to work my way back to the front. Ultimately decided with Billing to still give the 3200 a shot later and I actually went through the mile very well in like 5:02 but everything went down hill from there until I fell into last I think and got lapped by like 3 people... I gave that one everything though so I can't really be too upset. I'm really proud of Adam, Thomas and Walker though for stepping up and scoring in the 3200. Crazy stuff, they all ran great. I wish I could have contributed more to winning the CCC west but oh well, good job to everyone else who scored points. Time to get better and sleep a ton.

God there has to be 2 names for those. Anyway, I literally told Jack and Justin yesterday on xbox I was gonna go for a sub 10 equivalent which I guess was a bit too ambitious.

From the moment I started I knew I was in for a rough ride... I think I forgot how painful racing can be, I got a few interesting looks as I was huffing and puffing down the trail. First mile was 5:24 which is ok I guess, but then I just died, no other way to say it, finished with the tank on empty. Split 6:10 for the second mile which is just shocking and then chugged out the last .2 which is uphill. For context, I split a 6:10 mile at the end of my 13 mile long run last sunday...\n\nWhy did I race so poorly? Well, there could be a number of reasons. For one it was really hot today and I haven't raced in the heat in a whileeeeeee. Its all possible I didn't drink enough water, or I didn't get enough sleep, or the fact that I wore trainers not spikes and I didn't have a lot of traction. All of these are pretty much excuses though, the main reason is that I've been slacking off for this training cycle. I didn't build up mileage to as high as I wanted to, I didn't do core, hips, strength consistently, and my motivation to run has been slowly declining. A lot of that is because I was only allowed to run really early in the morning and it was so easy to come up with a thousand reasons laying in my bed to not get up and to just sleep in. Theres good news for that now, I'm allowed to run later again! Another thing is that I'm just not all that talented so I really do need a solid foundation to preform at my best.\n\nSo I'm gonna take a week off from running now, its more of a mental break than physical, and then get psyched to start training hard again throughout the summer. My goal is to be consistent with everything, to do everything I know I should be doing to get as fast as I can for the fall. Gonna get to high mileage, like Sam Frank high mileage and get into crazy good shape.\n\nAlso as soon as Im allowed to I'm going to start playing tennis again. It sucks that I missed a whole season and I haven't played in soooooooo long. The plan before the coronavirus was to work all summer at Hartford Tennis Club which was basically a dream job for me, I've wanted to work there since I did a camp there like 5 years ago. But now I'm not allowed to and even if I was I'm pretty sure they hired other people to replace me since I wasn't able to work.\n\nHowever, I'm still optimistic that later in the Summer and the beginning of next school year I'll be allowed to work there. And even before that I'm optimistic that I'll be able to play tennis with a friend at the hall courts sometimes soon. I'm also optimistic that I'll be allowed to run with someone else soon or my dad will bike next to me on some of my runs because it gets a bit boring sometimes.\n\nPoint is, lots of great things to come and I'm excited to start working hard again. Don't expect anyone to read all of this, this is mainly just something for myself. I'll be logging again on r2w in a week."},{"distanceUnit":0,"distance":4,"date":"2020-06-15T04:00:00.000Z","comments":"Gate to Gate at Res 6"},{"distanceUnit":0,"distance":4,"date":"2020-06-16T04:00:00.000Z","comments":"Not Specified"},{"distanceUnit":0,"distance":5,"date":"2020-06-17T04:00:00.000Z","timeSeconds":43,"timeMinutes":41,"timeHours":0,"paceSeconds":35,"paceMinutes":7,"paceHours":0},{"distanceUnit":0,"distance":4,"date":"2020-06-18T04:00:00.000Z","comments":"2.2 Miles"},{"distanceUnit":0,"distance":4,"date":"2020-06-19T04:00:00.000Z","timeSeconds":46,"timeMinutes":32,"timeHours":0,"paceSeconds":21,"paceMinutes":7,"paceHours":0,"comments":"12:32.00"},{"distanceUnit":0,"distance":4,"date":"2020-06-20T04:00:00.000Z"},{"distanceUnit":0,"distance":5,"date":"2020-06-22T04:00:00.000Z"},{"distanceUnit":0,"distance":5,"date":"2020-06-23T04:00:00.000Z","comments":"5:41.82"},{"distanceUnit":0,"distance":6,"date":"2020-06-25T04:00:00.000Z","timeSeconds":52,"timeMinutes":44,"timeHours":0,"paceSeconds":21,"paceMinutes":7,"paceHours":0},{"distanceUnit":0,"distance":5,"date":"2020-06-26T04:00:00.000Z","timeSeconds":37,"timeMinutes":43,"timeHours":0,"paceSeconds":23,"paceMinutes":7,"paceHours":0},{"distanceUnit":0,"distance":6,"date":"2020-06-27T04:00:00.000Z"},{"distanceUnit":0,"distance":4,"date":"2020-06-28T04:00:00.000Z","comments":"I'm back!

I think my calves were really sore today because I did a bunch of calf raises yesterday, which makes complete sense.\n\nI also got some good exercises from the guy on youtube to help strengthen calves because mine are obviously very weak. He also said hip exercises are good, which I do anyway, but I haven't been doing glute stuff that much and apparently that's good also.\n\nSo my plan is to stay at low mileage while doing all these good extra things until my calves aren't sore on my runs and then I'll start increasing mileage again.

So then I felt lower very close to the heel and it is very tender there. Then he explained something I don't really understand but apparently calf raises only help mid portion achilles tendinopathy and they actually worsen insertional achilles tendinopathy which is what I have. Anyways, I find it really dumb that I've been doing so many calf raises on stairs because that's what he told me to do to help strenghten my calves and just now im learning out that they can actaully be bad for my achilles.

Early AM with Drew again, wore the endorphin speeds which I may or may not use for long runs in the future, although I'll definitely wear them for john kelley. It feels weird running in them compared to the pure flows or torins, its SO MUCH easier. They're literally a running cheat code.\n\nLots of barefoot strides."},{"distanceUnit":0,"distance":7,"date":"2021-06-30T04:00:00.000Z","timeSeconds":55,"timeMinutes":57,"timeHours":0,"paceSeconds":51,"paceMinutes":7,"paceHours":0},{"distanceUnit":0,"distance":6,"date":"2021-07-01T04:00:00.000Z","timeSeconds":40,"timeMinutes":49,"timeHours":0,"paceSeconds":51,"paceMinutes":7,"paceHours":0,"comments":"A bit sore."},{"distanceUnit":0,"distance":11,"date":"2021-07-03T04:00:00.000Z","timeHours":1,"timeMinutes":13,"timeSeconds":44,"paceSeconds":41,"paceMinutes":6,"paceHours":0,"comments":"Easy up to the res, then pretty fast around the loop twice, then easy back down.

Now I'm going to shamelessly plug my strava go follow me im pretty sure its just Yonah Goldberg. Anywho the race went pretty well I think, it's pretty hard to compare a distance that I haven't run before to anything else but it was basically like a 17:10 5k then keep going another k. I'll say I definitely could have pushed harder but it's always so easy to say that in reflection so I'm just going to be happy and unsatisfied and train hard for our next meet in 2 weeks.\n\nWe raced against a bunch of schools in the area and came in second to Pitt, really close. I think I was like number 13 on the team (out of the 14 that raced insert crying emoji). Course was pretty cool, very wave mania like with a rolling grass trail through a meadow. It was a 2k loop so we just did that 3 times. In 2 weeks we will be coming back for an 8k and that will be 4 loops.\n\nSee you in 2 weeks for the next race recap."}]
